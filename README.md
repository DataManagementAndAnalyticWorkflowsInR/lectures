Recommended Reading:

- R Packages:
  - Read Karl Broman’s [*Why write an R
    package?*](https://kbroman.org/pkg_primer/pages/why.html)
  - Familiarize yourself with what’s in the R Packages book:
    <https://r-pkgs.org/> — having a rough familiarity with the
    different parts will be helpful. Our suggestion here is to try and
    approach this more in terms of “what are the ingredients in a good R
    Package?” rather than trying to learn how to craft all of those
    ingredients from the ground up immediately.
- R Markdown:
  - Check out the Get Started for R Markdown, especially the \~1 minute
    video intro on the first page:
    <https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html>
  - [*How R Helps Airbnb Make the Most of Its
    Data*](https://peerj.com/preprints/3182.pdf)
  - If you find yourself loving R Markdown, you may find the [*R
    Markdown Cookbook*](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/)
    useful, but it is incredibly comprehensive and we’d suggest it’s
    better to reference as you need it than to try to read it
    cover-to-cover.

Homework:

- Use R Markdown to document some exploratory data analysis.
