Recommended Reading: 

  * R Packages: 
    * Read Karl Broman's [*Why write an R package?*](https://kbroman.org/pkg_primer/pages/why.html)
    * Familiarize yourself with what's in the R Packages book: https://r-pkgs.org/
    â€” having a rough familiarity with the different parts will be helpful. Our
    suggestion here is to try and approach this more in terms of "what are the
    ingredients in a good R Package?" rather than trying to learn how to craft all
    of those ingredients from the ground up immediately.
  * R Markdown: 
    * Check out the Get Started for R Markdown, especially the ~1 minute video intro on the 
    first page: https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html 
    * [*How R Helps Airbnb Make the Most of Its Data*](https://peerj.com/preprints/3182.pdf)
    * If you find yourself loving R Markdown, you may find the [*R Markdown Cookbook*](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/)
    useful, but it is incredibly comprehensive and we'd suggest it's better to reference 
    as you need it than to try to read it cover-to-cover.
