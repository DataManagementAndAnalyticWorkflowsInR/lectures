# why version control? 

:::{.incremental}
  * makes coordinating files across computers easy üíª
  * keeps a clean history of your code evolution üìú
    * no need for messy suffixes (v1, v2, ..., v19380, vfinal) üóÇ
  * gives you the chance to ask yourself "do i really want to make these changes?" ü§î
  * streamlines review of external code changes üë•

## why git? 

  - it's popular! in the stackoverflow developer survey, 93.9% of developers
  using version control software said they use git.

  width='500px'
  alt="stackoverflow developer survey shows that 93.9% of developers who use version control use git"></a>

the result is that git comes with a *large resource base* and is *compatible* with all 
the major operating systems.

## a bit about git

:::{.incremental .smaller}
  - git is an **<span class='carrot'>open-source version control system</span>**.
  - git stores code and its history in a <span class='carrot'>**repository**</span>.
  - each revision to the code is added to the repository through a <span class='carrot'>**commit**</span> process.
  - git allows you to have **branches** of your code that keeps development <span class='carrot'>**separate**</span>
  from the main codebase until it is complete.
    - the main version of your code is often on the <span class='carrot'>**"main"**</span> branch
      (what used to be called the <span class='carrot'>**"master"**</span> branch).
  - git allows you to <span class='carrot'>**push**</span> or <span class='carrot'>**pull**</span> code from <span class='carrot'>**remote**</span> servers.

## github

:::{.incremental .small}
- github is a website and online service with free and paid tiers that
allows you to: 
  - host git repositories 
  - publicize your profile and repositories 
  - track issues
  - document your projects with wikis
  - host static websites
  - coordinate teams of developers
  - do project management

## personal reflections

:::{.incremental .smaller}
  - what features of git and github are you looking to leverage the most? 
  - look through examples of successful repositories
    - mathew kiang (assistant professor at stanford) has some great repositories
    focused on epidemiological and population health research
      - <https://github.com/mkiang> {{< fa brands github >}}
    - take a look at the repository for dplyr: <br> <https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr> {{< fa brands github >}}
:::

<!-- info / docs for the quarto fontawesome extension: 
https://github.com/quarto-ext/fontawesome --> 

:::{.notes}
we suggest the following points for personal reflection.

also, if you're working with high security code, you should contact your local 
it department before uploading anything to an external server like github. 
:::
    
## installation

:::{.incremental}
  - you‚Äôll need to install git: the installation procedures depend on if
you‚Äôre on windows, mac, or linux.
  - follow the installation instructions here https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html:
    - [download git for osx](https://git-scm.com/download/mac)
    - [download git for windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
    - [download git for linux](https://git-scm.com/download/linux)
:::
    
## local setup

:::{.incremental}
  - after installation, you'll need to **configure** git:
  
:::{.fragment .xsmall}
```sh
git config --global user.name 'she-ra, princess of power'
git config --global user.email 'adora@eternia.com'
git config --global --list
```
:::

  - use the **same name** and **email address** you are going
  to use with github.
  - i would highly recommend using a long-term personal email rather than your institutional
  email so it's easy to carry your portfolio of work on github on with you after
  you graduate.

some advice from happy git with r: 
:::

:::{.incremental}
  - incorporate your <span class='carrot'>**actual name**</span>
  - <span class='carrot'>**reuse your username**</span> from other contexts 
  - pick an <span class='carrot'>**appropriate**</span> username you will be comfortable revealing to future bosses
  - <span class='carrot'>**shorter** </span>is better
    - be as unique as possible in as few characters as possible
  - make it <span class='carrot'>**timeless**</span>
    - don't highlight your current university, employer, or place of
    residence since these can all change
  - all <span class='carrot'>**lowercase**</span> is recommended

## readmes

:::{.incremental}
  - a readme serves as an introduction to and documentation for
your repository.

  - like any documentation, feel free to start small and
document as you develop!

  - you can learn more about reamdes from github here: <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes">docs.github.com/...</a>

  area
  3. commit these changes with a
  explanatory message

`git status` is a basic command that displays the current state of the working directory.

your code because there may be something you want to commit or address first.

the output of `git status`.

together as a <span class='carrot'>**commit**</span>.

:::{.fragment .absolute .xxsmall .popup top='75%' left='-2.5%' width='45%'}
if you need to write a longer, multi-line commit, `git commit` will open 
your default terminal based text-editor (often one of nano, vi, or vim) where
you can write a longer commit message and save it.

## optimal commit messages üìÆ


:::{.incremental .small}
  - capitalize the first word and do not end in punctuation.
  - use imperative mood in the subject line.
    * example: ‚Äúadd fix for data reading error‚Äù
  - specify the type of commit. it is recommended and beneficial to have
    a consistent set of words to describe your changes.
    * example: bugfix, update, refactor, bump, and so on.
  - the first line should ideally be no longer than 50 characters.
    * be direct! try to eliminate filler words and phrases.
      * examples: though, maybe, i think, kind of.
