# Why version control? 

:::{.incremental}
  * makes coordinating files across computers easy 
  * keeps a clean history of your code evolution 
    * no need for messy suffixes (v1, v2, ..., v19380, vFINAL)
  * gives you the chance to ask yourself "do I really want to make these changes?"
  * streamlines review of external code changes

Maybe you already know other ways to share code?

## Why Git? 

  - It's popular! In the StackOverflow developer survey, 93.9% of developers
  using version control software said they use Git.

The result is that Git comes with a *large resource base* and is *compatible* with all 
the major operating systems.

## A bit about Git

:::{.incremental .smaller}
  - Git is an **open-source version control system**.
  - Git stores code and its history in a **repository**.
  - Each revision to the code is added to the repository through a **commit** process.
  - Git allows you to have **branches** of your code that keeps development **separate** 
  from the main codebase until it is complete.
    - The main version of your code is often on the **"main"** branch 
      (what used to be called the **"master"** branch).
  - Git allows you to **push** or **pull** code from **remote** servers.

## GitHub

   <div class="row">
  <div class="column">
:::{.incremental .small}
- GitHub is a website and online service with free and paid tiers that
allows you to: 
  - host Git repositories 
  - publicize your profile and repositories 
  - track issues
  - document your projects with wikis
  - host static websites
  - coordinate teams of developers
  - do project management
  - automate project workflows

## Personal Reflections

:::{.incremental .smaller}
  - What features of Git and GitHub are you looking to leverage the most? 
  - Look through examples of successful repositories
    - Mathew Kiang (Assistant Professor at Stanford) has some great repositories
    focused on epidemiological and Population Health research
      - <https://github.com/mkiang> {{< fa brands github >}}
    - Take a look at the repository for dplyr: <br> <https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr> {{< fa brands github >}}

:::{.notes}
We suggest the following points for personal reflection.

Also, if you're working with high security code, you should contact your local 
IT department before uploading anything to an external server like GitHub.

## Installation

  - You’ll need to install Git: the installation procedures depend on if
you’re on Windows, Mac, or Linux.
  - Follow the installation instructions here https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html:
    - [Download git for OSX](https://git-scm.com/download/mac)
    - [Download git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
    - [Download git for Linux](https://git-scm.com/download/linux)
    
## Local Setup

  - After installation, you'll need to **configure** Git:
  
```sh
git config --global user.name 'Jane Doe'
git config --global user.email 'jane@example.com'
git config --global --list
```

  - Make sure to use the **same name** and **email address** you are going 
  to use with GitHub.
  
## Setup a GitHub account

<div class='row'>
<div class='column' style='width: 70%;'>
:::{.small style='line-height: 100%;'}
Sign up at <https://github.com/login> <br>
Some advice from Happy Git With R: 

  - Incorporate your actual name 
  - Reuse your username from other contexts 
  - Pick a username you will be comfortable revealing to future bosses
  - **Shorter** is better
  - Be as unique as possible in as few characters as possible
  - Make it **timeless**
    - Don't highlight your current university, employer, or place of
    residence 
  - Recommend all **lowercase**

## Set up an SSH Key 

We recommend setting up **SSH (Secure Shell) key** based authentication with
GitHub.<br><br>

This allows your computer to be **automatically authenticated** when you communicate with GitHub.<br><br>

Follow the instructions here:<br>
<https://happygitwithr.com/ssh-keys.html>

## Set up a local repository in RStudio

<div class='row'>
<div class='column'>
Nativate to File → New Project<br><br>

Select “Create a git repository”
which informs RStudio you want to
use Git.
</div>
<div class='column'>

</div>

## Git panel in RStudio

<div class='row'>
<div class='column'>
:::{.smaller style='line-height: 100%'}
RStudio adds a Git tab in your
Environment/History panel.<br><br>

This panel is a point-and-click
interface to:

  - review your changes
  - stage changes
  - write commits
  - push and pull commits
  - view the commit history
  - navigate branches

## Setting up a remote repository 

Navigate to GitHub.com → Login → New Repository <br>
and fill out the form.

![](images/new_repo_form.png){.absolute top=150 right=0 width="500"}

## Formulate your initial commit and push it 

:::{.small}
```sh
git remote add origin git@github.com:ctesta01/ExampleRepository.git # let your local repository know about the remote repository
git branch -M main # use "main" as the default branch
git add .gitignore # add a file to the staging area
git commit -m "initial commit" # name your commit 
git push -u origin main # push your commit to the remote repository
```

## READMEs

  - A README serves as an introduction to and documentation for
your repository.

  - Like any documentation, feel free to start small and
document as you develop!

## Basic Workflow Overview 

<div class='row'>
<div class='column' style='width: 60%;'>
:::{.smaller style='line-height: 100%'}
The basic workflow for making
updates to a Git repository is done
in three steps:

  1. Making changes to your files
  2. Adding them to the staging
  area
  3. Commit these changes with a
  explanatory message

:::{style='font-size: 24px;'}
This figure from Happy Git with R shows
examples of commits made in a sequence.
Each commit is accompanied by an ID, a
message, and the differences between two
commits are referred to as a “diff”.

# Key Commands {background-color='black' background-image="images/mountains.jpg"}

## git status

`git status` is a basic command that displays the current state of the working directory. 

It's a good idea to always run `git status` before changing
your code because there may be something you want to commit or address first.

The RStudio Git panel displays most of what is displayed in 
the output of `git status`.

## git add

  - adds changes to the staging environment or index
