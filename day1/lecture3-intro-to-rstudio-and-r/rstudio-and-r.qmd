# let's start with RStudio {background-color='black' background-image="transition_slides/manuel-will.jpg" background-opacity='70%'}

## open up RStudio

first let's talk about what the different panes are.

:::{.notes}
What to notice: You should see four panes, and notice that there's a file-menu-bar (like File, Edit, etc., and Help)
:::

## source pane

<img src="images/rstudio_source_pane.png"/>

:::{.notes}
This is where you'll write your scripts and code that you save.

This is where you'll edit text based files in general.

You should try to use this pane a lot, because in general that means you're
leaning towards saving your work.
:::

## console pane

<img src="images/rstudio_console_pane.png"/>

:::{.notes}
This is the console pane;  This is where R commands are run and their
text-based output is shown.

You'll see that there are some friendly messages on startup about which 
version of R you're running, your default settings, etc.  **Do** read
those and think about them since they're put there to help you.

The bit about the ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY is really just saying you can't sue the
developers of R for giving out a free software program if it has a bug.  The R
community in general is very good about resolving bugs, so you shouldn't let
that alarm you.

Notice that this pane has a few more tabs to it, including the Terminal and
Background Jobs.  The Terminal tab is very close to the Terminal app on your
computer if you're running Mac OS or Linux.  The Terminal is very handy to have
closeby for programmers since it allows for very precise file manipulations and 
software operations.
:::

## environment pane

<img src="images/rstudio_environment_pane.png"/>

:::{.notes}
This pane is where you'll be able to see what variables you have loaded in your current R 
session. 

Notice that there's also History, Connections, and a Tutorial pane.

The History pane will keep a history of your commands you've run, and the Connections 
pane is there in case you want to connect to online databases.
:::

## files pane

<img src="images/rstudio_files_pane.png"/>

:::{.notes}
This is the files pane;  here you can navigate your computers' folders, open files, rename files, 
move files, delete files, etc. 

Notice that this quadrant also has Plots, Packages, Help, Viewer, and Presentation tabs.
