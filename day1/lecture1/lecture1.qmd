Hi!  I'm Christian Testa.  I've been a statistical analyst working at the
Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health for a little over 5 years.

My research has focused on population health data with respect to **policy interventions**, the **structural determinants of
health**, and the measurement of **health disparities and inequities** in the US.


Methods use in my research include: 

  * Bayesian statistics
  * Differential equations & simulation modeling
  * Hierarchical & spatial disease mapping
  * Flexible machine learning approaches
