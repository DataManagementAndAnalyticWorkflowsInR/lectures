# Intro to the Final Presentation Format

The final project will be group presentations on best practices related to a specific
aspect of data analysis and management. 

You'll be in groups of five and have fifteen minutes of time to present and a
brief Q&A afterwards.

## Rubric for the Final Project

You'll be evaluated on two aspects of your final presentations: 

  * Does the presentation describe principles and clear guidance on methods to achieve
those principles that can be applied in the context of the topic or subject
matter?
  * Does the presentation communicate how you have learned and grown through
completing the coursework?

## Supporting Examples

For example, let's say your final presentation topic is _data documentation._ 
We would want to hear: 
  
  * Why is data documentation important? 
  * What are some data documentation practices you think are applicable for basically every project?
  * How do you think having good data documentation could pay off? 
  * What are some data documentation practices or principles you learned during this course that you wouldn't have thought of before?
