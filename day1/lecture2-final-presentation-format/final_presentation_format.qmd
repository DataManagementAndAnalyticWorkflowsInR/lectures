## intro to the final presentation format

:::{.fragment}
<br>
the final project will be group presentations on best practices related to a specific
aspect of data analysis and management. 
:::

:::{.fragment}
<br>
you'll be in groups of five and have ten to twelve minutes of time to present and a
brief q&a afterwards.
:::

## final presentation topics

<center>
<div style="font-size: 30px !important; line-height: 30px;">

:::{.incremental}
  * clean code and code hygiene
  * data documentation and dictionaries
  * code commenting and documentation
  * how to present results from models
  * data visualization
  * exploratory data analysis
  * reporting on missing data
  * sharing code and open-source science
  * use of interactive web applications in data analysis
  * R project workflows
  * R package workflows
  * mapping in R

## rubric for the final project

:::{.fragment}
you'll be evaluated on two aspects of your final presentations: 
:::

:::{.incremental}
  * does the presentation describe <span class='carrot'>**principles and clear guidance**</span> on methods to achieve
those principles that can be applied in the context of the topic or subject
matter?
  * does the presentation communicate how you have <span class='carrot'>**learned and grown**</span> through
completing the coursework?
:::

## supporting examples

:::{.small}
:::{.fragment}
for example, let's say your final presentation topic is <span class='carrot'>**data documentation.**</span> 
:::

:::{.fragment}
we would want to hear: 
:::
  
:::{.incremental}
  * why is data documentation important? 
  * what are some data documentation practices you think are applicable for basically every project?
  * how do you think having good data documentation could pay off? 
  * what are some data documentation practices or principles you learned during this course that you wouldn't have thought of before? 
:::
:::
  
## depending on how ambitious you are 

:::{.small}
:::{.fragment}
you may want to aim for an A, A+, or A+++:
:::

:::{.incremental}
  * an A presentation would essentially act as a <span class='carrot'>**referenced compendium**</span> of advice
collected from online resources. 
  * an A+ presentation would go further into how to <span class='carrot'>**balance the challenges**</span> of adhering to 
best practices when there are competing interests.  an A+ presentation might also 
come with some <span class='carrot'>**deliverables**</span> that live on past the course (like a GitHub repository).
  * an A+++ presentation would be more ambitious in trying to perform a <span
class='carrot'>**data analysis**</span> project and using <span
class='carrot'>**challenges**</span> that come up in the course of the project
as opportunity to research best practices, apply them, and discuss how well they
met the group's needs.
