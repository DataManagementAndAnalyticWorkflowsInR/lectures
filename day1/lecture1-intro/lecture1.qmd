Hi!  I'm Christian Testa üëã  I've been a statistical analyst working at the
Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health for a little over 5 years.

My recent research has focused on addressing health disparities and
inequities in the US.  

These days I'm working on projects involving epigenetic
aging, multiple types of discrimination, COVID-19, and spatiotemporal
methods in epidemiology. <br><br>

Hi there! I‚Äôm Dean Marengi, a current PhD student in the Department of Environmental Health. I received my MPH in epidemiology from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, and have been involved in public health research for over ten years. Broadly, I am interested in studying the relationship between prenatal environmental exposures and the subsequent development of neuropsychiatric outcomes. <br><br>

I‚Äôm a self-taught R programmer who is very enthusiastic about data cleaning, and even more enthusiastic about helping others learn how to clean their data!

## our goals

<br>
our goal is to give you the roadmap, time, and space you need to grow your R
skills. <br><br>

all our lecture recordings and slides will be online so you can refer back to
them as you need to.

## some pep talk

:::{.smaller}
> It‚Äôs easy when you start out programming to get really frustrated and think, ‚ÄúOh it‚Äôs me, I‚Äôm really stupid,‚Äù or, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not made out to program.‚Äù But, that is absolutely not the case. Everyone gets frustrated. I still get frustrated occasionally when writing R code. It‚Äôs just a natural part of programming. So, it happens to everyone and gets less and less over time. Don‚Äôt blame yourself. Just take a break, do something fun, and then come back and try again later. <br><br>

## tracks for the course 

<div style='font-size: 32px;'>

keeping in mind that it's impossible to learn _all_ of r in any short period of
time, we want to encourage you to pick a track to focus your energy on the most.

::: {.incremental}
  - Beginner/Novice
  - Data Visualization
  - Data Cleaning/Management and Working with Codebooks
  - Programming and Software Engineering
  - Other Niche Topics in R
:::

:::{.notes}
  - Beginner/Novice
    - This track emphasizes learning the basics of R and RStudio, learning the terminology, data types, and how to formulate your questions/searches to best get help for R programming challenges.
  - Data Visualization
    - This track emphasizes data visualization skills, learning how to use ggplot2, and the important considerations that go into making an effective data visualization (e.g., communicative precise language, appropriate and meaningful use of legends, accessibility, etc.).
  - Data Cleaning/Management and Working with Codebooks
    - This track emphasizes how to go from a raw dataset to something that can be worked with in R, documenting the process, and making that process reproducible and robust.
  - Programming and Software Engineering
    - This track emphasizes the role of designing software systems, writing packages in R, clean code and code hygiene, and leveraging tools designed to accelerate the effectiveness of programmers like automated testing. 
  - Other Niche Topics in R
    - Is there a specific functionality available in R that you want to get better with not listed above?  Make sure to be precise.  Examples include interactive web applications, interactive data visualizations, machine learning pipelines, etc.

## homework 

:::{.smaller}
:::{.fragment}
each day will be accompanied by homework assignments that will be distributed
and submitted through github.  <br><br>
:::

:::{.fragment}
additionally, we are asking you to do peer reviews on the homework so that:
:::

:::{.incremental}
  1. you benefit from learning how others approached the same problem, and 
  2. you practice articulating constructive feedback related to programming in R.
:::
:::

## rubric for homework {.small}

:::{.fragment}
your homework will be evaluated on the following rubric:
:::

:::{.fragment}
+---+---+
| objective/principle                                     | percent of grade | 
| -----                                                   | -:              |
| does it accomplish the stated goal? is it complete?     | 25%             |
| is it well documented and commented?                    | 25%             |
| is it transparent and clearly motivated? is it elegant, i.e., not kludgey? | 25% | 
| does it incorporate what's been taught? does it reflect growth? | 25% | 
+---+---+
:::

:::{.fragment}
we really just want to see that you're <span class='carrot'>**learning**</span>, <span class='carrot'>**growing as a programmer**</span>, and
using the homeworks to <span class='carrot'>**challenge yourself in a healthy, productive way**</span>.

## class discussions {.smaller}

:::{.fragment}
throughout the class, we'll be having several discussion
based activities in various formats. <br><br>
:::

:::{.fragment}
we want to make sure everyone has a chance to shine, 
so please make sure that you 1) aren't dominating the discussions and 2) please be aware that your questions are
completely welcome in our discussions. <br><br>
:::

:::{.fragment}
if you would like to prepare for the discussions in advance,
make sure to take a look at the syllabus and timetables
on our course website for what we'll be covering in advance.

## slack & communication 

we'll be active on the <span class='carrot'>Slack</span> that is linked to 
through Canvas -- we'd love to see you on there,
to answer questions for you, and to see you collaborate
together.  if you are an enrolled (graded) student
and have questions you'd like the instructional team 
to answer, ask in <span class='carrot'>#student-questions</span>. please share 
fun stuff on the </span class='carrot'>#fun</span> channel ‚Äî doesn't have to 
be course related! <br><br>

if you have questions that you'd like to ask the instructional team in private, <span class='carrot'>
please email *all four of us*</span> and we'll reply-all to you so the whole
instructional team knows if your question has been answered by another one of
us.

## recordings 

we'll be recording the lectures (but not discussions) and posting them online so
you can refer back to them during the course and after.
