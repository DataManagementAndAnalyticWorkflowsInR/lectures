    Introduction to the Activity
        Introduce the topic of writing functions in R and the palmerpenguins dataset
        Explain the goals and objectives of the activity

    Setting up the Environment
        Have students install and load the necessary packages, including dplyr and ggplot2
        Have students load the palmerpenguins dataset and explore it briefly

    Writing Functions Together
        Divide the class into small groups and assign each group a task related to the palmerpenguins dataset
        Have each group work together to write a function to complete their assigned task
        Encourage groups to share their code and collaborate with each other

    Testing and Debugging Functions
        Have each group test their function on the palmerpenguins dataset to ensure it works correctly
        Have groups troubleshoot and debug any errors or issues with their functions

    Reviewing and Sharing Functions
        Have each group share their function with the class and explain how it works
        Discuss the different approaches and techniques used by each group
        Encourage the class to provide feedback and suggestions for improvement

    Conclusion and Next Steps
        Summarize the key points covered in the activity
        Encourage students to continue practicing writing functions in R and applying them to their own data.
